music-sheets is a collection of music sheets for my own personal piano study.

Source files in lilypond (https://lilypond.org) format

## How to build:
Suppose we wanted to build file `src/bach_preludio1.ly`, file `makefile` allows us to build from the command line as

``` shell
make bach_preludio1
```
This generates two output files in directory `out`: a `midi` and a `pdf` file.
